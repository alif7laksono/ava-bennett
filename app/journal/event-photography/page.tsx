          Event photography is an art that combines technical expertise and
          storytelling. Whether it’s a wedding, concert, or corporate event,

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          An event photographer isn’t just an observer; they are storytellers.
          Their goal is to capture not only the key moments but also the
          emotions and ambiance that make the event unique. This requires a
          balance of technical skills and interpersonal abilities.
