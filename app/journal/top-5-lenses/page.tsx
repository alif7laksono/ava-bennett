        <h2>Why Lenses Matter in Photography</h2>
        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          A lens determines how light enters the camera and interacts with the
          sensor. The quality of the glass, aperture, and focal length all play
          a crucial role in achieving sharp, vibrant images. Investing in a good
          lens is essential for photographers at any level.

          The right lens is an extension of your creativity, enabling you to
          tell your story with precision and style.
